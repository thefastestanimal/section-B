# String Method capitalize()

The capitalize() method in Python is a built-in string method that converts the first character of a string to uppercase and makes all other alphabetic characters lowercase.


## Syntax

string.capitalize()


## Returns:
     A new string where the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.
     
     If the string starts with a non-alphabetic character, only the case of alphabetic characters is adjusted.
